# About BloomFinder

BloomFinder is developing new ways of tracking wildflower blooms using social media, computer vision, and remote sensing. We are teaching computers to recognize [hundreds of common wildflowers](/#species) in mountain ecosystems across [dozens of sites](/#map) in the Western United States. We aim to set these algorithms loose on publicly available Flickr and Instagram photos to automatically detect when and where blooms happen. This data will help us get a better handle on how plants are affected by extreme weather events, which are becoming more frequent under climate change.

BloomFinder is led by [Ian Breckheimer](https://tinyplant.org) and [Charles Davis](http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~ccdavis/) in the [Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology](https://oeb.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University. Support from the project comes from the [National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/). Keep abreast of developments by following us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/BloomFinder) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/BloomFinder).
